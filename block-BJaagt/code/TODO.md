Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

Example:

```js
function hello() {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // username is not defined
```

In above code we are looking for the variable named `usename`. There is no variable named `username` in the global scope. The variable is inside the function named `hello` and we can't access the variable defined inside a function from outside.

The above code will throw an error `Reference Error username is not defined`.

2. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
{
  const username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```
Here we are trying to access block scoped variable from outside it will through an error `username` is not defined


3. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```
It will through an error because here username is block scoped so it will be an reference error.




4. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```
It will  print 'Arya'  because here username is defined with `var` whose scope is functional not block so it will print 'Arya'





5. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```

username hasbeen already declared so it will through an error.


6. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // John
```




7. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
function sayHello() {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
sayHello();
console.log(username); // 'John'
```



8. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'First'); // 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // 10
```

9. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'First'); // 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // i is not defined
```
